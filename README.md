# East Sussex Equine

Welcome to my first ever website! For my first ever site I wanted to choose a topic that lies close to my heart; horses. East Sussex Equine is a website that provides users the opportunity to learn more about our riding school, the training we provide and what to expect from learning to ride. We have something for everyone, whether you want to improve your horsemanship skills or simply try a fun new way of getting outdoors. The site will be for a stables based in East Sussex in England, an area I grew up in which has beautiful countryside perfect for exploring on horseback. The site will offer customers the opportunity to book riding sessions as well as providing contact details if they have anny further questions. The goal is to create a fun, friendly yet professional looking website providing plenty of information about our horse riding services, whilst also encouraging people to get closer to nature.
