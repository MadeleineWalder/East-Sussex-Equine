# East Sussex Equine

Welcome to my first ever website! For my first ever site I wanted to choose a topic that lies close to my heart; horses. East Sussex Equine is a website that provides users the opportunity to learn more about our riding school, the training we provide and what to expect from learning to ride. We have something for everyone, whether you want to improve your horsemanship skills or simply try a fun new way of getting outdoors. The site will be for a stables based in East Sussex in England, an area I grew up in which has beautiful countryside perfect for exploring on horseback. The site will offer customers the opportunity to book riding sessions as well as providing contact details if they have any further questions. The goal is to create a friendly yet professional looking website providing plenty of information about our horse riding services, whilst also encouraging people to get closer to nature.

-12th October 18.00 Just fixed an issue when creating the form. Or at least I think its fixed? After making all of the imputs and labels for the booking form including the radio buttons and submit button I couldnt work out why the form was showing up weirdly on the site. None of the imput boxes were showing, and neither were they radio buttons or submit form. I changed to background color of them using class attributes to get a better look at where they were. Something was wrong, only the input boxes could be seen and the were all overlapping and under the text of the labels. I thought at first that maybe I just needed to style them to fix it, but styling had no affect at all. After reseaching examples of html code for creating forms I couldn't find a problem with my code itself. I decided to copy and paste my code into a comment before deleting the original. This way I can keep my code to reference what I needed in the form and start re-writing it. So I began again with just one label and text input and focused on  trying to get that to work. I realised I just needed 1 more space in front of the code within the form, as shown in the screenshots I took. That has fixed the issue so far, at least for the 'Name' part of the form. Tomorrow I'll be adding the rest of the form and hoping it works now.

-13th October. Started my day by adding in the rest of the form and everything works fine. I've learnt my lesson about getting everything on the correct indentation. Now I can proceed to styling my form.
