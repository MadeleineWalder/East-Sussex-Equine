                <h3>Why Ride?</h3>

                <h3>What do I need?</h3>
                <p>
                    We recommend shoes with a thick heel such as boots or wellies. Avoid flat shoes such as trainers. If riding outdoors be prepared for the Great British weather! 
                    Riding gloves are advised in winter. We provide riding hats in all sizes, but you are welcome to use your own if you have one.
