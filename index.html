                <h3>Why Ride? <i class="fa-solid fa-horse-head"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    Horse riding is perfect for getting you and your family outdoors and closer to nature. Get fit and enjoy doing it! 
                    It's great for your core muscles, arms and legs. Our beautiful countryside is perfect for exploring on horseback. 
                    Learn in a fun, friendly environment or brush up on your skills.

                <h3>What do I need? <i class="fa-solid fa-hat-cowboy"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    We recommend shoes with a thick heel such as boots or wellies. Avoid flat shoes such as trainers. If riding outdoors be prepared 
                    for the Great British weather! Riding gloves are advised in winter. We provide riding hats in all sizes, but you are welcome to 
                    use your own if you have one.

                <p>
                    Our instructors have many years of valuable experience, and can guide you every step of the way no matter your level of knowledge.
                    All our horses are well trained and cared for. For safety reasons we never ride alone, so it's a great way to meet new people and 
                    make a few friends!
