                <p>
                    Horse riding is perfect for getting you and your family outdoors and closer to nature. Get fit and enjoy doing it! 
                    It's great for your core muscles, arms and legs. Our beautiful countryside is perfect for exploring on horseback. 
                    Learn in a fun, friendly environment or brush up on your skills.

                <p>
                    We recommend shoes with a thick heel such as boots or wellies. Avoid flat shoes such as trainers. If riding outdoors be prepared 
                    for the Great British weather! Riding gloves are advised in winter. We provide riding hats in all sizes, but you are welcome to 
                    use your own if you have one.

                    Our instructors have many years of valuable experience, and can guide you every step of the way no matter your level of knowledge.
                    All our horses are well trained and cared for. For safety reasons we never ride alone, so it's a great way to meet new people and 
                    make a few friends!

                    Indoor lessons take place in our arena and last roughly 1 hour. They are done in groups maximum of 6 and focus on improving the riders raw skills.
                    This is highly recommended for first time riders as you can master the very basics like getting on, walking, steering and most importantly stopping.
                    More advanced riders will proceed to other activities such as trotting, cantering, pole work and jumping. Whatever your level there is always something 
                    you can focus on here in a safe, enclosed environment.

                    During our outdoor rides an instructor (or several) will take a group of riders and horses out for a hack around the beautiful Sussex 
                    countryside that lies on our doorstep. The ride can last from 1 to 2 hours depending on the route chosen. There are several different 
                    trails which we like to follow and most of them go over the South Downs, an area of outstanding natural beauty. However this ride is 
                    not recommended for beginners. Riders must be able to walk, trot and canter whilst also being aware of their surroundings.
